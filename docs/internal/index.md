# Pages Administration

The department web pages are hosted at 
[github pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} 
and the content is stored in the
[ai4reason.github.io](https://github.com/ai4reason/ai4reason.github.io){:target="_blank"}
repository.
The pages contain 
+ web pages of the 
[department](https://usermap.cvut.cz/search/department/37210#25766){:target="_blank"}
(yellow buttons in the top menu),
and
+ web pages for each group (blue buttons).

Each web page collection has its own structure, with different sections (left buttons in the top navigation menu) and content.
Clicking the group blue button will take you to the group web pages.

## Automation

Each group pages contain two sections with automatically generated content.

1. **Members** with list of group _members_.
2. **Activities** with list of _publications_ from [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/){:target="_blank"}.

Furthermore, there is a [collective list of publication](/activities.html) by all the department members.
Additional content can be added in the
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/){:target="_blank"}
syntax using the
[github](https://github.com/ai4reason/ai4reason.github.io/tree/main/docs/groups){:target="_blank"}
web interface.
See [content update](/internal/content.html) and 
[publication list](/internal/biblio.html) for more information.

## Group members

🔴 IMPORTANT❗

For the automatically generated content to be valid, the list of group members
must be up to date.
The list of members of the department is stored in the repository file 
[docs/_data/members.yml](https://github.com/ai4reason/ai4reason.github.io/blob/main/docs/_data/members.yml/){:target="_blank"}
in the 
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML/){:target="_blank"} 
format.
🔥 **Make sure the list of members of your group is up to date.** 🔥
See [members update](/internal/members.html) for more information.
